InsideSound is an application to create albums with songs to listen to.

The project is divided into the following parts:
1) Evaluation of the graphical interface and ecosystems of uS
2) Kubernetes deployment evaluation
3) Migration of the ecosystems to a monolithic service that meets the design recommendations [notes](doc/recomendaciones.pdf)

In each branch you will be able to see the progress of the stages in videos.
